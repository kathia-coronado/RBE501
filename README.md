# RBE501
Robot Dynamics
Foundations and principles of robotic manipulation. Topics include computational models of objects and motion, the mechanics of robotic manipulators, the structure of manipulator control systems, planning and programming of robot actions. The focus of this class is on the kinematics and programming of robotic mechanisms. Important topics also include the dynamics, control, sensor and effector design, and automatic planning methods for robots. The fundamental techniques apply to arms, mobile robots, active sensor platforms, and all other computer-controlled kinematic linkages. The primary applications include robotic arms and mobile robots and lab projects would involve programming of representative robots. An end of term team project would allow students to program robots to participate in challenges or competitions. (Prerequisite: RBE 500 or equivalent.)
